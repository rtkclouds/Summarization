I try to stick to a Keto-based diet but it's hard because there are carbs in all sorts of foods.\nWhat is auto-brewery syndrome (ABS)? How rare condition believed to be caused by high levels of yeast in gut\u00a0Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) is believed to result from high levels of yeast and other fungi in the gut.\u00a0When the sufferer ingests sugar (glucose) - contained in carbohydrates - the yeast feeds off this to produce ethanol, or alcohol.\u00a0This is the same process that happens during the brewing of beer.\u00a0After fermentation, the resulting ethanol is then absorbed by the body and goes to the brain, in the same it does when you have an alcoholic drink. The only way to control the condition is by reducing the intake of carbohydrates and monitoring a sufferer's blood alcohol content.\u00a0ABS may also be caused by abnormal enzymes in the liver. Anyone of any age can suffer. The condition is so rare its prevalence is unknown and there is no cure.Avoiding sugar and carbohydrates may help to control symptoms, as well as frequently monitoring a sufferer's blood alcohol content.\n'I can go from being stone cold sober to being three times over the driving limit in a matter of minutes which is quite scary.\n'The effect isn't pleasant and I have sections of my memory where I have no idea what I've done. I just talk rubbish and walk around in circles.\n'It's like sleepwalking with activities - you're not aware of what you're up to even though you're still functioning and doing stuff.\n'One time I tried a small portion of low fat chips and I became so intoxicated that I lay in the living room, throwing up, before eventually passing out within 45 minutes of eating.'\nMr Carson first noticed the symptoms of ABS in 2003. He was layering a strong flooring solvent on a job at work and went home feeling very ill, before passing out.\nHis symptoms began to get worse from that point, but he only realised he could have the condition after it featured on ITV\u2019s Doc Martin.\nThe couple began to extensively research ABS, which can intoxicate someone who hasn't had alcohol and happens when the body turns sugary and starchy foods into alcohol.\nMr Carson said: 'Doctors said that the overexposure to the solvent seemed to trigger the reaction and when I ate sugary foods and carbs, it added fuel to the fire and fermented.\n'There's several triggers to ABS but antibiotics are usually involved - it's always a cascade of things that cause the problems.\n'I started having horrendous cravings for Victoria sponge cake, and I don't usually have a sweet tooth.\n'There are points where I would have killed for a slice of Victoria sponge and it's ridiculous - it triggers an appetite reflex in your brain.'\nMr Carson tries hard to avoid the triggers of ABS, but even the littlest bite of food can turn him worse for wear - meaning he has to constantly carry a breathalyser around to check he's not drunk.\nHis wife Karen, a 64-year-old podiatrist, ensures she records her husband during the sudden and uncontrollable outbursts of drunkenness to show him the next day.\nMr Carson said: 'It's unnerving and it attacks my sense of self and becomes like the matrix when you start to doubt what's real and what isn't.\n'When you wake up on the other side, there's a whole lot of psychological damage because you feel so guilty about what you said and did the night before.\n'Sometimes people treat my condition as a joke and say that I'll be cheap to take out because I don't need a drink but actually it's horrible.\n'As a general rule, I have a breathalyser that I use every hour. It's like tap dancing on a minefield and I'm constantly checking myself all the time.'\nBut Mr Carson doesn't let his condition get him down, and, alongside Karen, he has managed to control it a lot easier.\nHe is now speaking out for the first time in hopes of spreading awareness about auto-brewery syndrome.\nMr Carson added' 'I hope that sharing my story will help people become more knowledgeable about ABS.\n'I'm working on building up good bacteria through what I eat so we're trying to be as natural as possible. I'm sort of on a Keto diet with lots of vegetables and protein and I feel much better.\n'Now that I know a lot more about the condition it's become a little easier to manage. I think we're coping with it well and I want to keep the ball rolling.'\n"}, {"source": {"id": null, "name": "Daily Mail"}, "author": "Bryant Hevesi, Aap", "title": "Millions of Australians enjoy sun-soaked heatwave as temperatures soar across the nation", "description": "Melbourne hit 36.7C late on Monday afternoon, the city's hottest day in almost a year, with residents hitting the beach in droves to cool off.

Measuring up to 6in (15cm) in diameter, the vertebrae were previously estimated to have come from an individual about 30ft (9m) in length based on comparisons with vertebrae of modern great white sharks, according to the researchers.\u00a0The images revealed the vertebrae to have 46 growth bands, meaning that the nearly 30ft (9m) Megalodon fossil died at the age of 46.By back-calculating its body length when each band formed, the study suggests the shark's size at birth was about 6ft 7in (2m) in length, suggesting that megalodon gave live birth to possibly the largest babies in the shark world.\nKenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago and lead author of the study, said: 'As one of the largest carnivores that ever existed on Earth, deciphering such growth parameters of megalodon is critical to understand the role large carnivores play in the context of the evolution of marine ecosystems.'\nResearchers used a CT scanning technique to examine incremental growth bands in megalodon vertebral specimens housed in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels.\nMeasuring up to 6in (15cm) in diameter, the vertebrae were previously estimated to have come from an individual about 30ft (9m) in length, based on comparisons with vertebrae of modern great white sharks, according to the researchers.\nThe images revealed the vertebrae to have 46 growth bands, meaning that the nearly 30ft (9m) Megalodon fossil died at the age of 46.\nBy back-calculating its body length when each band formed, the study published in Historical Biology, suggests the shark's size at birth was about 6ft 7in (2m) in length, suggesting that megalodon gave live birth to possibly the largest babies in the shark world.\nResearchers say the data also indicates that, like all present-day lamniform sharks, embryonic megalodon grew inside their mother by feeding on unhatched eggs in the womb \u2013 a practice known as oophagy, a form of intrauterine cannibalism.\nCo-author Martin Becker, of William Paterson University, New Jersey, said: 'Results from this work shed new light on the life history of megalodon, not only how megalodon grew, but also how its embryos developed, how it gave birth and how long it could have lived.'\nThe findings come shortly after the same team shed light on the cannibalistic behaviours of megalodon sharks in the womb.\nSharks have a reproductive strategy known as ovoviviparity where embryos develop inside eggs that stay inside their mothers until they are ready to hatch.\nThis 'turns extreme' among shark species similar to the megalodon in that the first shark pup to hatch eats the rest of the eggs before they get a chance to develop.\nThis is a behaviour called intrauterine cannibalism and by the time the pup emerges from the mother it is already large and ready to defend against predators.\nComing out larger gives them a greater chance of finding food after they are born and couples with favourable water temperatures may have allowed them to hit the gigantic lengths the team claim they could reach.\n"}, {"source": {"id": null, "name": "Daily Mail"}, "author": "Luke May", "title": "Snow will make way for heavy downpours as milder air moves in from West", "description": "After a week of snow across Britain, milder temperatures and rain are expected to move in today, but warnings remain that a Beast from the East could bring Arctic conditions later this month.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9133647/Snow-make-way-heavy-downpours-milder-air-moves-West.html", "urlToImage": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/11/09/37857146-0-image-a-21_1610359041041.jpg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-11T10:18:16Z", "content": "Britain is set to swap snow for rain this week as milder temperatures take hold - but while the north faces a warning for ice, forecasters have predicted a new Beast from the East could arrive later \u2026 [+7031 chars]", "traducao": "As temperaturas se estabilizaram acima de zero na maior parte do pa\u00eds durante a noite, com m\u00ednimas de 0\u00baC em Shoreham e -1\u00baC nas ilhas Shetland.

but while the north faces a warning for ice, forecasters have predicted a new Beast from the East could arrive later this month.\nTemperatures settled\u00a0above freezing for most of the country overnight, with lows of 0C in Shoreham and -1C on the Shetland Islands.\nAs last week's cold snap comes to an end, rain and showers are set to be moving in across, with persistent downpours in the north west.\nOvernight more heavy rain has been forecast further south, with some snow still in northern parts of the country and more downpours forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.\nThis morning the Met Office issued another warning for ice in Scotland and northern England, starting from 3pm today and ending at around 11am tomorrow.\nNorthern parts of Scotland are being warned about potential disruption brought about by snow and rain, but the rest of the country is no longer under any weather warning.\nUp to 10cm of snow could fall on higher ground in Scotland today.\nIt comes after snow and ice still blanketed parts of northern England yesterday - amid concerns heavy snow and polar temperature could hit the UK later this month as conditions are coming into place for a second 'Beast from the East'.\nMeteorologists have confirmed that a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event is developing high above the Arctic, the same phenomenon which caused the country to grind to a halt two years ago.\nParts of the\u00a0stratosphere have already warmed by around 50C - which cannot be felt on earth's surface - and this has the power to interrupt the jet stream which controls much of Britain's weather.\nExperts say it is possible that the stream could be reversed, and that the country might be hit the freezing conditions currently seen in the north of Scandinavia.\n\u2018The stratosphere above the North Pole has warmed, it started its process on the 4th of January and has been rapidly warming over the last few days,' said Met Office forecaster Craig Snell.\nIt could result in the whole country being covered by heavy snow in blizzards, and daytime temperatures as low as -5C by the end of January and into February.\nThere are fears such an event would wreak havoc on the NHS and the ability to deliver food and vaccines to vulnerable people isolating at home.\nSimon Lee, an atmospheric science and weather forecasting researcher at the University of Reading, told The Mirror: 'A weakening of the jet stream often occurs after an SSW, meaning the UK is now more prone to outbreaks of colder weather from the north and east than it was before.\n'A weakened polar vortex can last for up to two months, so there is an increased likelihood of colder, drier weather occurring in Europe sometime in the next 4-6 weeks due to weaker Atlantic westerly winds.\n'This also means we are less likely to see the kind of windstorms and heavy rainfall associated with a strong jet stream that we experienced last winter.\n'Major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events occur on average slightly more often than once every other winter.\n'When the polar vortex is strong, the jet stream is often strong \u2013 bringing a milder winter to the UK and often an increase in Atlantic windstorms.'\nIn the 2018 event, the\u00a0Met Office issued a red snow warning, its highest level, meaning the weather could cause damage to buildings and roads.\nInsurers AA estimated that more than \u00a310 million of damage was done to cars in just three days as the Beast from the East pounced on the UK's roads.\nThere were sixteen specifically weather-related deaths, although official data found that the extreme weather event may have increased mortality rates to the highest level since 2009.\nThe freezing conditions left passengers on train in Lewisham, east London, stranded for over four hours, and even set back the growth of Royal Jersey potatoes by three weeks.\nHowever it is not yet known whether Britain will be hit by the same harsh conditions as 2018, which Met forecaster Craig Snell said were a 'perfect storm'.\n'It takes a good few weeks for it (the SSW) to have an impact at the earth's surface so we can\u2019t say for sure yet what it will do to UK weather,' added Craig.\n'There is an increased chance of blocking the usual weather pattern of the UK but it will depend on where we are on that blockage - north or south - whether we will see similar weather to 2018.'\nYesterday, freezing fog settled across London and parts of the south east after temperatures dropped well below freezing overnight - as a weather warning for ice continued over parts of Britain.\nTemperatures dropped as low as -12C in Scotland on Saturday, with Brighton recording overnight temperatures of -3C, and London seeing the mercury fall to -2C.\nIt comes after a week of snow and ice for large parts of the country - with a Met Office weather warning still in place.\nMost of Scotland and northern England were warned to take care on the roads due to ice, with the Met Office warning freezing temperatures could cause 'some injuries from slips and falls'.\n"}, {"source": {"id": null, "name": "Daily Mail"}, "author": "Antonia Paget", "title": "Man who sprayed hand sanitiser at Tesco staff and customers is jailed for 16 months", "description": "Adam Waring, 31, sprayed a bottle of sanitiser at the faces of customers and staff at the Tesco store in Walkden, Greater Manchester.

But now, Apple has suspended the fast-emerging Twitter competitor from its App store, claiming Parler is not doing enough to squash \"threats of violence and illegal activity.\"\u00a0Google has done the same, claiming an \"ongoing and urgent public safety threat,\" while Amazon has\u00a0announced it will no longer host the platform on its web services, effectively shutting it down.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nIt is a frightening and outrageous attack on free speech in this country,\u00a0 which was founded\u00a0to protect just such freedoms.\u00a0Republican lawmakers need to\u00a0stand up to these tech giants; they can start by\u00a0campaigning\u00a0in 2022\u00a0to\u00a0revoke\u00a0the protections granted\u00a0these firms by\u00a0Section 230\u00a0of the Communications Decency Act.\nThat clause in the 1996 law states\u00a0that\u00a0\"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\nThe\u00a0provision\u00a0has been\u00a0hailed\u00a0by\u00a0the Internet community\u00a0as protecting\u00a0free speech.\u00a0Today, critics charge\u00a0that Twitter, Facebook et al. have abrogated their side of the deal by censoring content, acting as a publisher.\nIt is the ultimate irony that in their warning note to Parler, Apple declared that \"Parler is in fact responsible for all the user-generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users.\"\nNeedless to.\u00a0say,\u00a0Parler\u00a0claims otherwise.\u00a0Parler\u2019s CEO John Matze said in an interview he did not\u00a0\"feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we\u2019re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law.\"\nIt is interesting to note that most European countries\u00a0do not\u00a0offer their social\u00a0media firms, which pale in comparison to our\u00a0behemoths,\u00a0any\u00a0such protections.\u00a0It is not a stretch to imagine that Section 230 has helped\u00a0enable\u00a0our firms\u00a0to\u00a0grow and that removing those protections\u00a0might slow them down.\nBig Tech is also vulnerable to antitrust charges. Surely trying to shut down an emerging competitor is an extreme abuse of power. There are already four anti-trust cases that have been brought against Google; the trust-busters are being handed new evidence daily. A Democrat-run Justice Department will not likely press these cases, but the Republicans will not be in Siberia forever.\nThe industry\u00a0saw storm clouds gathering\u00a0and, by\u00a0throwing\u00a0their enormous weight behind Biden, sought to curry favor with Democrats.\nWe get it:\u00a0the\u00a0Left feels empowered. They have elected a Democrat president who will enjoy for at least two years a Democrat majority in the House and Senate. At the same time, President Trump will soon leave office a defeated man, subject of endless recriminations by Democrats and non-stop condemnation from the liberal media. Trump is threatened with impeachment once again by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose appetite for partisan nastiness appears insatiable.\nBig Tech is empowered too, having played an important role in the election of Joe Biden.\u00a0The social media giants lean left politically; their campaign donations to\u00a0Biden and\u00a0suppression of negative articles about\u00a0him and\u00a0his son Hunter Biden were\u00a0all in service to electing their favored candidate.\nBut,\u00a0it was also a smart preemptive strike against liberal Democrats who have rightly accused Twitter and Facebook\u2019s CEOs of abusing their immense power. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., among others, has called for those big tech firms to be broken into pieces.\nThe industry\u00a0saw storm clouds gathering\u00a0and, by\u00a0throwing\u00a0their enormous weight behind Biden, sought to curry favor with Democrats.\u00a0By\u00a0banning\u00a0dissemination of unflattering stories about Hunter\u00a0Biden, who apparently used his father\u2019s position in the Obama White House to wangle lucrative business deals in Ukraine and China, Big Tech\u00a0has chips to call in when needed.\nIt is important to note that the\u00a0stories about\u00a0Biden\u2019s son\u00a0are not empty accusations; the New York Post ran well-documented pieces describing Hunter\u2019s shady activities \u2013 stories which have never been denied by Joe Biden or his son. In response, Twitter shut down the account of the New York Post.\nFor Americans who believe that free and fair elections are more than a campaign slogan,\u00a0the silencing constituted\u00a0unimaginable\u00a0interference.\nAlarmingly, the reverence Americans once held for free speech is fast disappearing. Michelle Obama became the newest face of partisan rage and censorship when she recently called for Twitter, Facebook et al. to permanently ban President Trump.

He appealed for people not to stop and chat to friends they bump into while outside their homes.Limits on individuals from different households exercising together also look to be in the pipeline as the government scrambles for ways of lowering transmission.Prof Whitty told BBC Breakfast: 'We have a very significant problem. The next few weeks are going to be the worst weeks of this pandemic in terms of the numbers into the NHS.'He added: 'This is everybody's problem.'Prof Whitty said: 'This is the most dangerous time we have really had in terms of numbers into the NHS at this particular time.'The UK announced a further 573 coronavirus deaths yesterday in the highest Sunday rise since April, and the third-deadliest Sunday of the entire pandemic as it emerged as many as one in five of all people in England may have had coronavirus. It could be as high as one in two people in some areas of east London and Essex, the modelling by Edge Health claims.Infections also continue to be high, with 54,940 announced yesterday - the thirteenth day in a row they have been above the 50,000 mark.\nThe raw infection data highlights the disparity between the official tally by Public Health England and the true number of cases.\nIn Barking, Edge estimates 115,460 people have previous had Covid-19, compared to just 14,665 confirmed PHE cases. There was a similar theme in Newham, where there were an estimated 173,058 infections to PHE's 21,683. In Thurrock the figure was 79,223 versus 12,007 and in Redbridge it was 130,806 compared to 22,125.\nThe model estimates that 39 per cent of the populations in Liverpool and Manchester have had Covid at some point, with 193,428 and 213,389 infections, respectively. Those estimates are six times higher than the official tolls.\nThe four areas with the lowest infections are all in the South West \u2014 in Devon (5.9 per cent), Dorset (5.8 per cent), Cornwall (4.8 per cent) and Torbay (7.5 per cent). Because Covid relies on dense populations and lots of social interactions to spread, rural areas have been spared the worst of its effects.\nEdge Health estimated the total cases by looking at the total number of\u00a0Covid-19-attributed deaths, published by the\u00a0Office for National Statistics, in each local authority area.\nThe team then worked backwards to estimate the number of cases that must have occurred in order to lead to the deaths. They did this using modelling which took into account the age demographic in each area, social deprivation and other variables than increase people's chances of dying to Covid.\nGeorge Batchelor, the co-founder and director of Edge Health, told the Guardian: 'Reported tests are only a fraction of the picture of total infections, which show how badly hit London and the north-west have been during the pandemic. It is incredible that the level of understanding of where and how infections are occurring is not greater at this stage, since it would allow control measures to be more targeted.\n'Even with imminent vaccinations, it is crucial to develop this understanding so that future variants of the virus can be effectively controlled and managed.'\nIt comes as Chris Whitty today warned the next few weeks are set to be the worst yet for the NHS as the government threatened to make lockdown even tougher.\nThe chief medical officer took to the airwaves to highlight the scale of the threat, saying that there are 30,000 people in hospital compared to the peak of 18,000 in April.\nAmid a crackdown on stopping to chat in the street and in shops, Prof Whitty urged people to remember that 'every unnecessary contact' was an opportunity for the virus to spread.\nHe insisted that although the the NHS was in the 'most dangerous situation anyone can remember' vaccines mean the UK can be back to normal in 'months not years' - but he cautioned that the situation is a long way from that currently.\nThe intervention came amid fears that the number of daily deaths is on track to rise to 2,000, with Boris Johnson looking at tightening the national lockdown rules even more dramatically if cases keep surging.\nThere are claims ministers have discussed going as far as saying people can only leave the house once a week - although No10 today denied this was on the cards - as well as compulsory mask-wearing outdoors and a ban on extended bubbles.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning suggested that shops are in the firing line, stressing the need for everyone to wear masks and follow one-way systems in supermarkets.

Though they agreed to share the 28 properties in both of their names, they entered into a court battle over 12 homes written solely in his name.\nA High Court judge has now ruled that seven of the 12 properties -\u00a0most of which are on the Thames riverside in London - should be shared.\nDuring the trial at London's High Court in October, the judge heard that the couple had only been together a year when Mr Collins, then working as an estate agent, received a six-month jail sentence for false accounting, which he served in 1997.\nWhile behind bars, her ex had sent Mrs Oberman a series of letters mapping out plans for their future together and the business they would build, her barrister Jack Watson told Judge Tom Leech QC.\n'While in prison, Mr Collins sent a number of letters to Ms Oberman and they discussed the business they would build together,' he said.\n'Mr Collins wrote to Ms Oberman informing her that there would be \"much to do and organise\" and that he was \"actually getting very excited about doing so much together\".'\nMr Watson said the letters made it clear it was a joint business, with Mr Collins telling her they needed to 'push on' so that their family could be 'strong and successful'.\n'Ms Oberman's evidence is that from this she understood that the business would be owned jointly,' he added.\nMr Watson said following Mr Collins' release from prison, he came to live with Ms Oberman and was 'reliant upon her for financial support'.\nHe told the court she sold her flat in Wessex Drive, Erith, and poured the money into the joint business.\nMs Oberman also invested money gifted by her parents, and put in unpaid work on the basis that the property portfolio they were building was equally owned, Mr Watson said.\nHe said Mr Collins had 'continuously represented' that they were joint owners of the portfolio, starting at the very birth of the business in his letters from prison.\nThe couple split in 2015 and, despite agreeing that they shared many of the properties in the portfolio, ended up in court in a fight over those held in Mr Collins' sole name.\nMr Collins had accepted that properties held in both of their names were held jointly, and that as a shareholder she had a right to a share of others held in the name of the company.\nHowever, he insisted that she had no rightful claim to 12 properties - mostly on the Thames riverside in London - which had been bought and had only his name on the deeds.\nBut ruling against him, Judge Leech said he was convinced that all of the properties - whether in both names, the name of the company, or Mr Collins' alone - were part of the business.\nMrs Oberman understood from what Mr Collins had told her that the entire portfolio, including those in his name, were held for them jointly and so were to be equally shared.\nActing on that belief, she had allowed him to control the properties, while herself working on them and allowing herself to become subject to financial liabilities based on them.\nJudge Leech rejected Mr Collins' claim that he had only transferred a 47 per cent stake in the property business, Bluegen Ltd, to Mrs Oberman out of 'love and affection' rather than because she was entitled to it as a partner in a joint venture.\n'It was inconsistent with his letters from prison and his description of Mrs Oberman as his business partner,' said the judge.\n'I have found that it was the common intention of the parties that the portfolio of properties acquired in the name of Bluegen and their joint and sole names were to be held on behalf of Mr Collins and Ms Oberman jointly and equally,' he said.\n'I have also found that Ms Oberman relied on that common intention to her detriment by her financial commitment, working in the business and by assuming financial liabilities in relation to the portfolio and giving control over it to Mr Collins.\n'In my judgment, these findings are sufficient as a matter of law to give rise to a common intention constructive trust of the properties in the portfolio.'\nAt all times between 2008 and 2015, all of the properties had been treated as part of 'a single portfolio in common ownership' and there had been an 'express agreement' about that, he said.\nThe judge made a declaration that seven of the 12 properties held in Mr Collins' name should be shared equally.\nHowever, the other five are subject to claims by third parties and the judge did not make any declaration in relation to them.\nThe judge also found that Mr Collins had conducted the business in a way that was 'unfairly prejudicial' to Mrs Oberman's interests as a member of the company.\nHe ordered that she be bought out by Mr Collins and she also receive her share of money made from the properties over the years.\n"}, {"source": {"id": null, "name": "Daily Mail"}, "author": "", "title": "Video: Customer kicks through a glass door after 'refusing to scan QR code'", "description": "Furious McDonald's customer kicks through a glass door after 'refusing to scan a QR code.'", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2330138/Video-Customer-kicks-glass-door-refusing-scan-QR-code.html", "urlToImage": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/11/09/37857176-0-image-a-42_1610358601705.jpg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-11T09:49:29Z", "content": "1:53\r\nSurrey emergency mortuary set up to deal with growing covid deaths", "traducao": "Ex-namorado mata mulher na frente de sua fam\u00edlia e de seu filho ", "resumo": "Ex-boyfriend murders woman in front of her family and their child", "texto": "Ex-boyfriend murders woman in front of her family and their child\n"}, {"source": {"id": null, "name": "Daily Mail"}, "author": "Ali Daher", "title": "Alli Simpson pays tribute to brother Cody with a childhood throwbacks to mark his 24th birthday", "description": "Cody Simpson celebrated turning 24 on Monday.

She was already boarding the plane and she said the weather conditions were not good. I said pray a lot, please.'\nA fisherman, named Solihin, told the BBC that he had been at sea when he witnessed the plane crash into the water near to his ship.\n'The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water. It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship.\n'We thought it was a bomb or a tsunami since after that we saw the big splash from the water.\n'It was raining heavily and the weather was so bad...\u00a0We were very shocked and directly saw the plane debris and the fuel around our boat.'\nLocals on a nearby island said they heard two explosions before discovering metal pieces, cables and fragments of a pair of jeans floating in the sea.\nThe missing plane is an older model than the Boeing 737 MAX jet involved in two earlier fatal crashes - including the Indonesian Lion Air crash in 2018 which killed 189.\nTransportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said the doomed flight was delayed for an hour before it took off at 2.36pm.\nBut the aircraft disappeared from radar four minutes later, after the pilot contacted air traffic control to ascend to an altitude 8,839 meters.\nSriwijaya Air, which flies to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little about the plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.\nThe Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003.\nBut the Southeast Asian nation's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.\nIn October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.\nThat accident - and another in Ethiopia - saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.\nThe 737 model that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.\nIn 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.\nA year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.\n"}]
