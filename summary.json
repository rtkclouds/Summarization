O homem de 62 anos, de Lowestoft, Suffolk, tem que respirar a cada hora e regularmente anseia pelo enfadonho bolo Victoria Sponge, apesar de saber o mal que ele pode fazer, da mesma forma que um alcoólatra desejaria uma bebida. O Sr. Carson disse: 'Basicamente, tornei-me um alcoólatra involuntário porque essa condição o torna um, quer você queira ou não. É o mesmo processo que ocorre durante a fabricação da cerveja. 'Às vezes as pessoas tratam minha condição como uma piada e dizem que vou ser barato para levar porque não preciso de uma bebida, mas na verdade é horrível. “Estou trabalhando para desenvolver bactérias boas por meio do que como, então estamos tentando ser o mais natural possível.

    "texto": "A business owner today revealed how a rare condition that has turned his gut into a personal brewery means that eating a slice of cake can leave him so drunk he passes out.\nNick Carson has auto brewery syndrome - where his body ferments carbohydrates and turns them into alcohol in his intestines - leaving him dangerously intoxicated without him touching a drop of alcohol.\nThe 62-year-old, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, has to breathalyse himself every hour and regularly craves stodgy Victoria Sponge cake despite knowing the harm it could do, the same way an alcoholic would hanker after a drink.\nThe cleaning business owner developed the condition after being exposed to strong chemicals at work almost 20 years ago - but it took years until he was finally diagnosed after he and his wife, Karen saw it featured on an episode of Doc Martin.\nABS's erratic triggers mean he has no idea where or when he might get drunk and pass out, and has to carry a breathalyser with him at all times.\nMr Carson said: 'I've basically become an involuntary alcoholic because this condition makes you one, whether you want to be or not.\n'Having a little bit of sugar or carbohydrates can quickly make me become drunk. I try to stick to a Keto-based diet but it's hard because there are carbs in all sorts of foods.\nWhat is auto-brewery syndrome (ABS)? How rare condition believed to be caused by high levels of yeast in gut Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) is believed to result from high levels of yeast and other fungi in the gut. When the sufferer ingests sugar (glucose) - contained in carbohydrates - the yeast feeds off this to produce ethanol, or alcohol. This is the same process that happens during the brewing of beer. After fermentation, the resulting ethanol is then absorbed by the body and goes to the brain, in the same it does when you have an alcoholic drink. The only way to control the condition is by reducing the intake of carbohydrates and monitoring a sufferer's blood alcohol content. ABS may also be caused by abnormal enzymes in the liver. Anyone of any age can suffer. The condition is so rare its prevalence is unknown and there is no cure.Avoiding sugar and carbohydrates may help to control symptoms, as well as frequently monitoring a sufferer's blood alcohol content.\n'I can go from being stone cold sober to being three times over the driving limit in a matter of minutes which is quite scary.\n'The effect isn't pleasant and I have sections of my memory where I have no idea what I've done. I just talk rubbish and walk around in circles.\n'It's like sleepwalking with activities - you're not aware of what you're up to even though you're still functioning and doing stuff.\n'One time I tried a small portion of low fat chips and I became so intoxicated that I lay in the living room, throwing up, before eventually passing out within 45 minutes of eating.'\nMr Carson first noticed the symptoms of ABS in 2003. He was layering a strong flooring solvent on a job at work and went home feeling very ill, before passing out.\nHis symptoms began to get worse from that point, but he only realised he could have the condition after it featured on ITV’s Doc Martin.\nThe couple began to extensively research ABS, which can intoxicate someone who hasn't had alcohol and happens when the body turns sugary and starchy foods into alcohol.\nMr Carson said: 'Doctors said that the overexposure to the solvent seemed to trigger the reaction and when I ate sugary foods and carbs, it added fuel to the fire and fermented.\n'There's several triggers to ABS but antibiotics are usually involved - it's always a cascade of things that cause the problems.\n'I started having horrendous cravings for Victoria sponge cake, and I don't usually have a sweet tooth.\n'There are points where I would have killed for a slice of Victoria sponge and it's ridiculous - it triggers an appetite reflex in your brain.'\nMr Carson tries hard to avoid the triggers of ABS, but even the littlest bite of food can turn him worse for wear - meaning he has to constantly carry a breathalyser around to check he's not drunk.\nHis wife Karen, a 64-year-old podiatrist, ensures she records her husband during the sudden and uncontrollable outbursts of drunkenness to show him the next day.\nMr Carson said: 'It's unnerving and it attacks my sense of self and becomes like the matrix when you start to doubt what's real and what isn't.\n'When you wake up on the other side, there's a whole lot of psychological damage because you feel so guilty about what you said and did the night before.\n'Sometimes people treat my condition as a joke and say that I'll be cheap to take out because I don't need a drink but actually it's horrible.\n'As a general rule, I have a breathalyser that I use every hour. It's like tap dancing on a minefield and I'm constantly checking myself all the time.'\nBut Mr Carson doesn't let his condition get him down, and, alongside Karen, he has managed to control it a lot easier.\nHe is now speaking out for the first time in hopes of spreading awareness about auto-brewery syndrome.\nMr Carson added' 'I hope that sharing my story will help people become more knowledgeable about ABS.\n'I'm working on building up good bacteria through what I eat so we're trying to be as natural as possible. I'm sort of on a Keto diet with lots of vegetables and protein and I feel much better.\n'Now that I know a lot more about the condition it's become a little easier to manage. I think we're coping with it well and I want to keep the ball rolling.'\n"

    "traducao": "Medindo até 15 metros de comprimento, os tubarões gigantescos megalodontes já foram os predadores mais temíveis a vagar pelos oceanos. Os pesquisadores usaram tomografia computadorizada para examinar bandas de crescimento incrementais em espécimes vertebrais de megalodonte alojados no Instituto Real Belga de Ciências Naturais em Bruxelas. As imagens revelaram que as vértebras tinham 46 bandas de crescimento, o que significa que o fóssil de Megalodon de quase 30 pés (9 m) morreu aos 46 anos. Calculando novamente o comprimento do corpo quando cada banda se formou, o estudo sugere que o tamanho do tubarão ao nascer era de cerca de 2 m de comprimento, sugerindo que o megalodon deu à luz a possivelmente os maiores bebês do mundo dos tubarões. As descobertas foram feitas logo após a mesma equipe lançar luz sobre os comportamentos canibalísticos dos tubarões megalodontes no útero. Os tubarões têm uma estratégia reprodutiva conhecida como ovoviviparidade, em que os embriões se desenvolvem dentro de óvulos que ficam dentro de suas mães até que estejam prontos para eclodir. Ficar maior dá a eles uma chance maior de encontrar comida depois de nascerem e casais com temperaturas favoráveis ​​da água podem ter permitido que eles atingissem os comprimentos gigantescos que a equipe afirma que poderiam alcançar.

Researchers used CT scanning to examine incremental growth bands in megalodon vertebral specimens housed in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. The images revealed the vertebrae to have 46 growth bands, meaning that the nearly 30ft (9m) Megalodon fossil died at the age of 46.By back-calculating its body length when each band formed, the study suggests the shark's size at birth was about 6ft 7in (2m) in length, suggesting that megalodon gave live birth to possibly the largest babies in the shark world. The findings come shortly after the same team shed light on the cannibalistic behaviours of megalodon sharks in the womb. Sharks have a reproductive strategy known as ovoviviparity where embryos develop inside eggs that stay inside their mothers until they are ready to hatch.

Measuring up to 6in (15cm) in diameter, the vertebrae were previously estimated to have come from an individual about 30ft (9m) in length based on comparisons with vertebrae of modern great white sharks, according to the researchers. The images revealed the vertebrae to have 46 growth bands, meaning that the nearly 30ft (9m) Megalodon fossil died at the age of 46.By back-calculating its body length when each band formed, the study suggests the shark's size at birth was about 6ft 7in (2m) in length, suggesting that megalodon gave live birth to possibly the largest babies in the shark world.\nKenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago and lead author of the study, said: 'As one of the largest carnivores that ever existed on Earth, deciphering such growth parameters of megalodon is critical to understand the role large carnivores play in the context of the evolution of marine ecosystems.'\nResearchers used a CT scanning technique to examine incremental growth bands in megalodon vertebral specimens housed in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels.\nMeasuring up to 6in (15cm) in diameter, the vertebrae were previously estimated to have come from an individual about 30ft (9m) in length, based on comparisons with vertebrae of modern great white sharks, according to the researchers.\nThe images revealed the vertebrae to have 46 growth bands, meaning that the nearly 30ft (9m) Megalodon fossil died at the age of 46.\nBy back-calculating its body length when each band formed, the study published in Historical Biology, suggests the shark's size at birth was about 6ft 7in (2m) in length, suggesting that megalodon gave live birth to possibly the largest babies in the shark world.\nResearchers say the data also indicates that, like all present-day lamniform sharks, embryonic megalodon grew inside their mother by feeding on unhatched eggs in the womb – a practice known as oophagy, a form of intrauterine cannibalism.\nCo-author Martin Becker, of William Paterson University, New Jersey, said: 'Results from this work shed new light on the life history of megalodon, not only how megalodon grew, but also how its embryos developed, how it gave birth and how long it could have lived.'\nThe findings come shortly after the same team shed light on the cannibalistic behaviours of megalodon sharks in the womb.\nSharks have a reproductive strategy known as ovoviviparity where embryos develop inside eggs that stay inside their mothers until they are ready to hatch.\nThis 'turns extreme' among shark species similar to the megalodon in that the first shark pup to hatch eats the rest of the eggs before they get a chance to develop.\nThis is a behaviour called intrauterine cannibalism and by the time the pup emerges from the mother it is already large and ready to defend against predators.\nComing out larger gives them a greater chance of finding food after they are born and couples with favourable water temperatures may have allowed them to hit the gigantic lengths the team claim they could reach.\n"

    "traducao": "As temperaturas se estabilizaram acima de zero na maior parte do país durante a noite, com mínimas de 0ºC em Shoreham e -1ºC nas ilhas Shetland. Até 10 cm de neve podem cair em terras mais altas na Escócia hoje. Partes da estratosfera já aqueceram cerca de 50 ° C - o que não pode ser sentido na superfície da Terra - e isso tem o poder de interromper a corrente de jato que controla grande parte do clima da Grã-Bretanha. Há temores de que tal evento possa causar estragos no NHS e na capacidade de entregar alimentos e vacinas a pessoas vulneráveis que se isolam em casa. Simon Lee, um pesquisador de ciência atmosférica e previsão do tempo da Universidade de Reading, disse ao The Mirror: 'Um enfraquecimento da corrente de jato geralmente ocorre após um SSW, o que significa que o Reino Unido está agora mais sujeito a surtos de clima mais frio do norte e do leste do que era antes. No entanto, ainda não se sabe se a Grã-Bretanha será atingida pelas mesmas condições adversas de 2018, que o analista do Met Craig Snell disse ser uma \"tempestade perfeita\". ",
    "resumo": "Temperatures settled above freezing for most of the country overnight, with lows of 0C in Shoreham and -1C on the Shetland Islands. Up to 10cm of snow could fall on higher ground in Scotland today. Parts of the stratosphere have already warmed by around 50C - which cannot be felt on earth's surface - and this has the power to interrupt the jet stream which controls much of Britain's weather. There are fears such an event would wreak havoc on the NHS and the ability to deliver food and vaccines to vulnerable people isolating at home. Simon Lee, an atmospheric science and weather forecasting researcher at the University of Reading, told The Mirror: 'A weakening of the jet stream often occurs after an SSW, meaning the UK is now more prone to outbreaks of colder weather from the north and east than it was before. However it is not yet known whether Britain will be hit by the same harsh conditions as 2018, which Met forecaster Craig Snell said were a 'perfect storm'.",

but while the north faces a warning for ice, forecasters have predicted a new Beast from the East could arrive later this month.\nTemperatures settled above freezing for most of the country overnight, with lows of 0C in Shoreham and -1C on the Shetland Islands.\nAs last week's cold snap comes to an end, rain and showers are set to be moving in across, with persistent downpours in the north west.\nOvernight more heavy rain has been forecast further south, with some snow still in northern parts of the country and more downpours forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.\nThis morning the Met Office issued another warning for ice in Scotland and northern England, starting from 3pm today and ending at around 11am tomorrow.\nNorthern parts of Scotland are being warned about potential disruption brought about by snow and rain, but the rest of the country is no longer under any weather warning.\nUp to 10cm of snow could fall on higher ground in Scotland today.\nIt comes after snow and ice still blanketed parts of northern England yesterday - amid concerns heavy snow and polar temperature could hit the UK later this month as conditions are coming into place for a second 'Beast from the East'.\nMeteorologists have confirmed that a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event is developing high above the Arctic, the same phenomenon which caused the country to grind to a halt two years ago.\nParts of the stratosphere have already warmed by around 50C - which cannot be felt on earth's surface - and this has the power to interrupt the jet stream which controls much of Britain's weather.\nExperts say it is possible that the stream could be reversed, and that the country might be hit the freezing conditions currently seen in the north of Scandinavia.\n‘The stratosphere above the North Pole has warmed, it started its process on the 4th of January and has been rapidly warming over the last few days,' said Met Office forecaster Craig Snell.\nIt could result in the whole country being covered by heavy snow in blizzards, and daytime temperatures as low as -5C by the end of January and into February.\nThere are fears such an event would wreak havoc on the NHS and the ability to deliver food and vaccines to vulnerable people isolating at home.\nSimon Lee, an atmospheric science and weather forecasting researcher at the University of Reading, told The Mirror: 'A weakening of the jet stream often occurs after an SSW, meaning the UK is now more prone to outbreaks of colder weather from the north and east than it was before.\n'A weakened polar vortex can last for up to two months, so there is an increased likelihood of colder, drier weather occurring in Europe sometime in the next 4-6 weeks due to weaker Atlantic westerly winds.\n'This also means we are less likely to see the kind of windstorms and heavy rainfall associated with a strong jet stream that we experienced last winter.\n'Major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events occur on average slightly more often than once every other winter.\n'When the polar vortex is strong, the jet stream is often strong – bringing a milder winter to the UK and often an increase in Atlantic windstorms.'\nIn the 2018 event, the Met Office issued a red snow warning, its highest level, meaning the weather could cause damage to buildings and roads.\nInsurers AA estimated that more than £10 million of damage was done to cars in just three days as the Beast from the East pounced on the UK's roads.\nThere were sixteen specifically weather-related deaths, although official data found that the extreme weather event may have increased mortality rates to the highest level since 2009.\nThe freezing conditions left passengers on train in Lewisham, east London, stranded for over four hours, and even set back the growth of Royal Jersey potatoes by three weeks.\nHowever it is not yet known whether Britain will be hit by the same harsh conditions as 2018, which Met forecaster Craig Snell said were a 'perfect storm'.\n'It takes a good few weeks for it (the SSW) to have an impact at the earth's surface so we can’t say for sure yet what it will do to UK weather,' added Craig.\n'There is an increased chance of blocking the usual weather pattern of the UK but it will depend on where we are on that blockage - north or south - whether we will see similar weather to 2018.'\nYesterday, freezing fog settled across London and parts of the south east after temperatures dropped well below freezing overnight - as a weather warning for ice continued over parts of Britain.\nTemperatures dropped as low as -12C in Scotland on Saturday, with Brighton recording overnight temperatures of -3C, and London seeing the mercury fall to -2C.\nIt comes after a week of snow and ice for large parts of the country - with a Met Office weather warning still in place.\nMost of Scotland and northern England were warned to take care on the roads due to ice, with the Met Office warning freezing temperatures could cause 'some injuries from slips and falls'.\n"

Fascists Get Out!' and 'Trump/Pence Out Now' amid calls for the president to be impeached a second time for inciting the Capitol riot.\nWhile the march appeared mostly peaceful, one hardline Trump supporter claimed she was 'assaulted' by protesters who allegedly egged her and harassed her with an umbrella while she tried to film the protest.\nAn Antifa group in New York claimed the march as as an 'anti-fascist victory' after few Trump supporters turned out to challenge them, saying that 'MAGA and the Proud Boys didn't show up because we mobilized'.\nFears of renewed violence have led to a crackdown by social media giants against Trump and some of his supporters, with last week's siege raising concerns over what will happen at next week's Biden inauguration.\nThe NYC protest came a day after clashes between Trump supporters and Antifa protesters in San Diego, where rocks, bottles and eggs were thrown at police during what was declared an unlawful assembly.\nTelevision footage showed black-clad Antifa protesters throwing a folding chair and spraying a chemical irritant at another group of people on the Pacific Beach boardwalk.\nIn Washington, the Capitol has been surrounded by fencing after the Trump-supporting mob overran the scaffolding that had been put up ahead of Biden's swearing in on January 20.\nThe inauguration has already been scaled back because of the pandemic and is further out of the ordinary because Trump will not be attending to see his successor take the oath.\nWashington's mayor has asked for increased security around the inauguration amid fears that far-right extremists are planning further violence.\nMore than 6,000 members of the National Guard from Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland will help support the Capitol Police and other law enforcement in Washington for the next 30 days.\nThe Secret Service is also overseeing security at the event along with other federal agencies including the Department of Defense.\nBiden told reporters on Friday that he has 'great confidence in the Secret Service' and their ability to make sure the inauguration 'goes off safely.'\n"

But now, Apple has suspended the fast-emerging Twitter competitor from its App store, claiming Parler is not doing enough to squash \"threats of violence and illegal activity.\" Google has done the same, claiming an \"ongoing and urgent public safety threat,\" while Amazon has announced it will no longer host the platform on its web services, effectively shutting it down.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nIt is a frightening and outrageous attack on free speech in this country,  which was founded to protect just such freedoms. Republican lawmakers need to stand up to these tech giants; they can start by campaigning in 2022 to revoke the protections granted these firms by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\nThat clause in the 1996 law states that \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\nThe provision has been hailed by the Internet community as protecting free speech. Today, critics charge that Twitter, Facebook et al. have abrogated their side of the deal by censoring content, acting as a publisher.\nIt is the ultimate irony that in their warning note to Parler, Apple declared that \"Parler is in fact responsible for all the user-generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users.\"\nNeedless to. say, Parler claims otherwise. Parler’s CEO John Matze said in an interview he did not \"feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we’re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law.\"\nIt is interesting to note that most European countries do not offer their social media firms, which pale in comparison to our behemoths, any such protections. It is not a stretch to imagine that Section 230 has helped enable our firms to grow and that removing those protections might slow them down.\nBig Tech is also vulnerable to antitrust charges. Surely trying to shut down an emerging competitor is an extreme abuse of power. There are already four anti-trust cases that have been brought against Google; the trust-busters are being handed new evidence daily. A Democrat-run Justice Department will not likely press these cases, but the Republicans will not be in Siberia forever.\nThe industry saw storm clouds gathering and, by throwing their enormous weight behind Biden, sought to curry favor with Democrats.\nWe get it: the Left feels empowered. They have elected a Democrat president who will enjoy for at least two years a Democrat majority in the House and Senate. At the same time, President Trump will soon leave office a defeated man, subject of endless recriminations by Democrats and non-stop condemnation from the liberal media. Trump is threatened with impeachment once again by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose appetite for partisan nastiness appears insatiable.\nBig Tech is empowered too, having played an important role in the election of Joe Biden. The social media giants lean left politically; their campaign donations to Biden and suppression of negative articles about him and his son Hunter Biden were all in service to electing their favored candidate.\nBut, it was also a smart preemptive strike against liberal Democrats who have rightly accused Twitter and Facebook’s CEOs of abusing their immense power. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., among others, has called for those big tech firms to be broken into pieces.\nThe industry saw storm clouds gathering and, by throwing their enormous weight behind Biden, sought to curry favor with Democrats. By banning dissemination of unflattering stories about Hunter Biden, who apparently used his father’s position in the Obama White House to wangle lucrative business deals in Ukraine and China, Big Tech has chips to call in when needed.\nIt is important to note that the stories about Biden’s son are not empty accusations; the New York Post ran well-documented pieces describing Hunter’s shady activities – stories which have never been denied by Joe Biden or his son. In response, Twitter shut down the account of the New York Post.\nFor Americans who believe that free and fair elections are more than a campaign slogan, the silencing constituted unimaginable interference.\nAlarmingly, the reverence Americans once held for free speech is fast disappearing. Michelle Obama became the newest face of partisan rage and censorship when she recently called for Twitter, Facebook et al. to permanently ban President Trump. Imagine – silence the elected leader of the \"Free World\" who just received 74 million votes in November.\nObama isn’t just hoping to silence the president; she wants all those Trump-loving \"deplorables\" shut down as well.\nBiden campaigned on \"bringing the country together\"; his chance of success plummets as disaffected Republicans see conservative voices silenced by Big Tech. At least 50% of GOP voters think the election was unfair. That is a lot of people to anger.\nRepublicans must find a way to bring Twitter, Facebook and other social media giants to heel. Given the relentless and increasingly dishonest bias of the liberal media, the availability of social media platforms is one of the few avenues left to push back against the Left’s indoctrination of the nation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThis is the most challenging issue – and must become the most potent campaign platform for Republicans in 2022.\nDemocrats rail that Republicans are just sore losers, but Big Tech’s assault on our freedom of speech is a loss for the entire nation.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK\n"

    "texto": "One in five people in England may have had coronavirus, according to modelling which estimates the true infection number is five times higher than the official toll.\nThe Government's Covid-19 dashboard says there has been 2.4million cases of the disease since the outbreak swept the UK in February, or four per cent of the country's population.\nBut analysis by Edge Health suggests that the actual number of infections could be as high as 12.4million, the equivalent of 22 per cent of people.\nThe model used to arrive at the figure compares Covid-19 deaths in each area of England against an estimated infection mortality rate.\nIt revealed that estimated cases are more than five times the official count in 77 places in England, just over half the 149 local authorities analysed.\nIn some parts of London and Essex — which were the initial hotspots in spring and are now struggling with the highly infectious new strain — the true infection toll could be eight times higher, with up to one in two people estimated to have contracted the virus.\nIn Manchester and Liverpool, which became the epicentres during autumn as the epidemic shifted north, the actual case number is thought to be six times higher than the Government's count, with four in 10 having had Covid.\nGeorge Batchelor, co-founder and director of Edge Health, said it was 'incredible' how out of whack the official testing regime was with the country's epidemic, saying it was only painting 'a fraction of the picture of total infections'.\nIt's widely accepted that the actual number of Brits who've had the disease is far higher than the official toll because of asymptomatic cases and a lack of testing or people not coming forward for tests. This was particularly true at the start of the pandemic when Britain's lacklustre testing scheme meant swabs were only reserved for the sickest Covid patients in hospital.\nScroll down to see the true infections in YOUR area\nEdge's data suggests the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham Newham and Redbridge, and Thurrock in Essex, have had the highest proportion of Covid cases of anywhere in England.\nThe model found 54.2 per cent of the population had caught the virus in Barking, 49 per cent in Newham, 45.4 per cent in Thurrock and 42.9 per cent in Redbridge.\nChris Whitty warns 'next few weeks will be worst' yet as ministers may 'only allow people to leave home ONCE a week, ban chat in supermarkets and bring in curfews' amid fears of 2,000 deaths a DAY   Chris Whitty today warned the next few weeks are set to be the worst yet for the NHS as the government begs people not to 'push the boundaries' of the lockdown - and threatens to make it even tougher. The chief medical officer took to the airwaves to highlight the scale of the threat, saying that there are 30,000 people in hospital compared to the peak of 18,000 in April.Amid a crackdown on stopping to chat in the street and in shops, Prof Whitty urged people to remember that 'every unnecessary contact' was an opportunity for the virus to spread.He insisted that although the the NHS was in the 'most dangerous situation anyone can remember' vaccines mean the UK can be back to normal in 'months not years' - but he cautioned that the situation is a long way from that currently.The intervention came amid fears that the number of daily deaths is on track to rise to 2,000, with Boris Johnson looking at tightening the national lockdown rules even more dramatically if cases keep surging.A Whitehall source told MailOnline ministers have discussed going as far as saying people can only leave the house once a week - although No10 today denied this was on the cards. Other ideas include compulsory mask-wearing outdoors and a ban on extended bubbles.Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning suggested that shops are in the firing line, stressing the need for everyone to wear masks and follow one-way systems in supermarkets. He appealed for people not to stop and chat to friends they bump into while outside their homes.Limits on individuals from different households exercising together also look to be in the pipeline as the government scrambles for ways of lowering transmission.Prof Whitty told BBC Breakfast: 'We have a very significant problem. The next few weeks are going to be the worst weeks of this pandemic in terms of the numbers into the NHS.'He added: 'This is everybody's problem.'Prof Whitty said: 'This is the most dangerous time we have really had in terms of numbers into the NHS at this particular time.'The UK announced a further 573 coronavirus deaths yesterday in the highest Sunday rise since April, and the third-deadliest Sunday of the entire pandemic as it emerged as many as one in five of all people in England may have had coronavirus. It could be as high as one in two people in some areas of east London and Essex, the modelling by Edge Health claims.Infections also continue to be high, with 54,940 announced yesterday - the thirteenth day in a row they have been above the 50,000 mark.\nThe raw infection data highlights the disparity between the official tally by Public Health England and the true number of cases.\nIn Barking, Edge estimates 115,460 people have previous had Covid-19, compared to just 14,665 confirmed PHE cases. There was a similar theme in Newham, where there were an estimated 173,058 infections to PHE's 21,683. In Thurrock the figure was 79,223 versus 12,007 and in Redbridge it was 130,806 compared to 22,125.\nThe model estimates that 39 per cent of the populations in Liverpool and Manchester have had Covid at some point, with 193,428 and 213,389 infections, respectively. Those estimates are six times higher than the official tolls.\nThe four areas with the lowest infections are all in the South West — in Devon (5.9 per cent), Dorset (5.8 per cent), Cornwall (4.8 per cent) and Torbay (7.5 per cent). Because Covid relies on dense populations and lots of social interactions to spread, rural areas have been spared the worst of its effects.\nEdge Health estimated the total cases by looking at the total number of Covid-19-attributed deaths, published by the Office for National Statistics, in each local authority area.\nThe team then worked backwards to estimate the number of cases that must have occurred in order to lead to the deaths. They did this using modelling which took into account the age demographic in each area, social deprivation and other variables than increase people's chances of dying to Covid.\nGeorge Batchelor, the co-founder and director of Edge Health, told the Guardian: 'Reported tests are only a fraction of the picture of total infections, which show how badly hit London and the north-west have been during the pandemic. It is incredible that the level of understanding of where and how infections are occurring is not greater at this stage, since it would allow control measures to be more targeted.\n'Even with imminent vaccinations, it is crucial to develop this understanding so that future variants of the virus can be effectively controlled and managed.'\nIt comes as Chris Whitty today warned the next few weeks are set to be the worst yet for the NHS as the government threatened to make lockdown even tougher.\nThe chief medical officer took to the airwaves to highlight the scale of the threat, saying that there are 30,000 people in hospital compared to the peak of 18,000 in April.\nAmid a crackdown on stopping to chat in the street and in shops, Prof Whitty urged people to remember that 'every unnecessary contact' was an opportunity for the virus to spread.\nHe insisted that although the the NHS was in the 'most dangerous situation anyone can remember' vaccines mean the UK can be back to normal in 'months not years' - but he cautioned that the situation is a long way from that currently.\nThe intervention came amid fears that the number of daily deaths is on track to rise to 2,000, with Boris Johnson looking at tightening the national lockdown rules even more dramatically if cases keep surging.\nThere are claims ministers have discussed going as far as saying people can only leave the house once a week - although No10 today denied this was on the cards - as well as compulsory mask-wearing outdoors and a ban on extended bubbles.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning suggested that shops are in the firing line, stressing the need for everyone to wear masks and follow one-way systems in supermarkets. He appealed for people not to stop and chat to friends they bump into while outside their homes.\nLimits on individuals from different households exercising together also look to be in the pipeline as the government scrambles for ways of lowering transmission.\nProf Whitty told BBC Breakfast: 'We have a very significant problem. The next few weeks are going to be the worst weeks of this pandemic in terms of the numbers into the NHS.' He added: 'This is everybody's problem.'\nProf Whitty said: 'This is the most dangerous time we have really had in terms of numbers into the NHS at this particular time.'\nThe UK announced a further 573 coronavirus deaths yesterday in the highest Sunday rise since April, and the third-deadliest Sunday of the entire pandemic as it emerged as many as one in five of all people in England may have had coronavirus. It could be as high as one in two people in some areas of east London and Essex, the modelling by Edge Health claims.\nInfections also continue to be high, with 54,940 announced yesterday - the thirteenth day in a row they have been above the 50,000 mark.\n"

He's better and I'm hoping there's improvement more to come, but it can leave long lasting problems.'\nMark then made an impassioned plea to people to listen to the government and follow the rules pertaining social distancing, mask wearing and household mixing.\nHe said: 'The message is what it should have been and has been from the start, like Kate has tried to promote on Good Morning Britain until you see it first hand, that might be the day you realise I need to buck up my ideas, but then it might be too late.'\n'I have good friends who are conspiracy theorists and they think it's all rubbish and you don't need to be locking down the country.\n'My answer is, the Government, whether they are right or wrong, they know more than you, so, if they are telling you to do this, do it.\n'Because until you get to a point where I am now, and I've had the hardest few weeks of my life and looking at basically potentially losing family members who are close to you or them being very sick.\n'You will regret doing what you are doing.

    "texto": "A mother-of-two has won her High Court battle for a slice of an £8million property empire her rags-to-riches ex promised in letters written from behind bars two decades ago.\nNicola Oberman, 53, took multimillionaire buy-to-let mogul Shaun Collins to court claiming she was an equal owner of a string of more than 40 Kent and London properties built up over their 22-year relationship.\nThe pair had only been dating for a year in 1997 when then-estate agent Mr Collins was jailed for six months for false accounting, London's High Court heard.\nBut while behind bars, a besotted Mr Collins sent Mrs Oberman a series of letters mapping out plans for their future together and outlining the business they would build, her lawyers said.\nHe made good on his promise and, two decades and two children later, the couple sat atop a 40-strong property empire.\nBut the pair, who never married, split in 2015. Though they agreed to share the 28 properties in both of their names, they entered into a court battle over 12 homes written solely in his name.\nA High Court judge has now ruled that seven of the 12 properties - most of which are on the Thames riverside in London - should be shared.\nDuring the trial at London's High Court in October, the judge heard that the couple had only been together a year when Mr Collins, then working as an estate agent, received a six-month jail sentence for false accounting, which he served in 1997.\nWhile behind bars, her ex had sent Mrs Oberman a series of letters mapping out plans for their future together and the business they would build, her barrister Jack Watson told Judge Tom Leech QC.\n'While in prison, Mr Collins sent a number of letters to Ms Oberman and they discussed the business they would build together,' he said.\n'Mr Collins wrote to Ms Oberman informing her that there would be \"much to do and organise\" and that he was \"actually getting very excited about doing so much together\".'\nMr Watson said the letters made it clear it was a joint business, with Mr Collins telling her they needed to 'push on' so that their family could be 'strong and successful'.\n'Ms Oberman's evidence is that from this she understood that the business would be owned jointly,' he added.\nMr Watson said following Mr Collins' release from prison, he came to live with Ms Oberman and was 'reliant upon her for financial support'.\nHe told the court she sold her flat in Wessex Drive, Erith, and poured the money into the joint business.\nMs Oberman also invested money gifted by her parents, and put in unpaid work on the basis that the property portfolio they were building was equally owned, Mr Watson said.\nHe said Mr Collins had 'continuously represented' that they were joint owners of the portfolio, starting at the very birth of the business in his letters from prison.\nThe couple split in 2015 and, despite agreeing that they shared many of the properties in the portfolio, ended up in court in a fight over those held in Mr Collins' sole name.\nMr Collins had accepted that properties held in both of their names were held jointly, and that as a shareholder she had a right to a share of others held in the name of the company.\nHowever, he insisted that she had no rightful claim to 12 properties - mostly on the Thames riverside in London - which had been bought and had only his name on the deeds.\nBut ruling against him, Judge Leech said he was convinced that all of the properties - whether in both names, the name of the company, or Mr Collins' alone - were part of the business.\nMrs Oberman understood from what Mr Collins had told her that the entire portfolio, including those in his name, were held for them jointly and so were to be equally shared.\nActing on that belief, she had allowed him to control the properties, while herself working on them and allowing herself to become subject to financial liabilities based on them.\nJudge Leech rejected Mr Collins' claim that he had only transferred a 47 per cent stake in the property business, Bluegen Ltd, to Mrs Oberman out of 'love and affection' rather than because she was entitled to it as a partner in a joint venture.\n'It was inconsistent with his letters from prison and his description of Mrs Oberman as his business partner,' said the judge.\n'I have found that it was the common intention of the parties that the portfolio of properties acquired in the name of Bluegen and their joint and sole names were to be held on behalf of Mr Collins and Ms Oberman jointly and equally,' he said.\n'I have also found that Ms Oberman relied on that common intention to her detriment by her financial commitment, working in the business and by assuming financial liabilities in relation to the portfolio and giving control over it to Mr Collins.\n'In my judgment, these findings are sufficient as a matter of law to give rise to a common intention constructive trust of the properties in the portfolio.'\nAt all times between 2008 and 2015, all of the properties had been treated as part of 'a single portfolio in common ownership' and there had been an 'express agreement' about that, he said.\nThe judge made a declaration that seven of the 12 properties held in Mr Collins' name should be shared equally.\nHowever, the other five are subject to claims by third parties and the judge did not make any declaration in relation to them.\nThe judge also found that Mr Collins had conducted the business in a way that was 'unfairly prejudicial' to Mrs Oberman's interests as a member of the company.\nHe ordered that she be bought out by Mr Collins and she also receive her share of money made from the properties over the years.\n"

'A consciência do povo de Wuhan sobre prevenção e controle de epidemias é muito alta - até meu neto de dois anos usa uma máscara quando sai', acrescentou Xiong.

But today, Wuhan was forced to shut its markets once again and launched a mass-testing campaign after two people from China's new Covid-19 epicentre in the northern Hebei province near Beijing visited the city before testing positive, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. 'Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China,' Dr Tedros said during a news conference in Geneva. Mass-testing campaigns in Shijiazhuang's other districts are still ongoing.

    "texto": "One year ago, China announced the first death from a new virus in Wuhan - 12 months later, Covid-19 has claimed 1.9 million lives in an unrelenting march across the world.\nBut in the central Chinese city of 11 million where the first known outbreak started, the virus has been extinguished and residents are proud of its revival.\nOn Monday morning, the anniversary slipped by unmarked in Wuhan - commuters moved freely to work while parks and riverside promenades buzzed with walkers in a city determined to banish its tag as the coronavirus ground zero.\n'Wuhan is the safest city in China now, even the whole world,' 66-year-old resident Xiong Liansheng said.\n'The Wuhan people's awareness of epidemic prevention and control is very high -- even my two-year-old grandson will wear a mask when going out,' Xiong added.\nBut today, Wuhan was forced to shut its markets once again and launched a mass-testing campaign after two people from China's new Covid-19 epicentre in the northern Hebei province near Beijing visited the city before testing positive, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.\nThe news comes as a year ago, in a sparse report, China confirmed its first death from an unknown virus - a 61-year-old man, a regular at the now-notorious Wuhan wet market, was linked to many of the early cases.\nThe world would soon become grimly familiar with the disease that killed him as Covid-19.\nLittle is still known about the first victim, including his name, while the market where the first reported clusters of cases were traced back to has remained closed, surrounded by boarding.\nAfter a long wrangle, China on Monday said independent experts from the WHO will be allowed into the country from Thursday, with the international community hoping they can visit the market and retrace in detail those early days of the virus in Wuhan.\nThe city has now bounced back and residents are revelling in the freedoms they enjoy.\nCommuters headed to work and others strolled along the riverfront - a sharp contrast to the countries still under strict lockdowns and restrictions.\nElderly couples danced, some masked, but hands clasped as social distancing withered in the winter sunshine in a busy park next to the Yangtze river.\n'Most cases in China are imported from overseas now and our country has a good control of it,' said Zhong, an 80-year-old woman giving only one name.\n'All the Wuhan people feel very safe in the city, and we come here and dance happily everyday.'\nChina has faced criticism at home and abroad over its initial handling of the virus, including attempts to silence whistleblowers and failure to report cases for days in early January.\nTwo weeks after confirming the first death, Wuhan and the surrounding province were put under lockdown.\nChinese authorities are trying to stamp out a series of local outbreaks, reporting 103 new infections on Monday -- the highest figure since July last year - most in northern Hebei province.\nChina claims its ban on a WHO mission to find the origin of coronavirus is a 'misunderstanding'  China has said it is still negotiating with the World Health Organisation over the dates and itinerary for a visit by international experts looking into the origins of Covid-19. It comes after the head of the agency criticised Beijing for not finalising permissions for the mission.China's position on the hunt for the origins of the pandemic 'has always been open and responsible', said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying.She said that China is in close co-operation with the WHO. However, the dates and itinerary need to be finalised, she said.'The origins problem is very complex. To ensure that the work of the global experts group in China is successful and to carry out the necessary procedures and relevant concrete plans, currently both sides are still in negotiations on this,' Ms Hua told a regular press briefing.'I understand that it's not just a visa problem and the actual date and itinerary. Both sides are still in close communication.' An international team of experts had been due to visit the central city of Wuhan in January, where the pandemic first appeared a year ago.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that members of the international scientific team began departing from their home countries over the last 24 hours as part of an arrangement between the WHO and the Chinese government.'Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China,' Dr Tedros said during a news conference in Geneva.'I'm very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute, but had been in contact with senior Chinese officials,' he said.The Chinese government has been strictly controlling all research at home into the origins of the virus, an Associated Press investigation found, and state-owned media have played up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere.\nThe country saw its biggest daily increase in COVID-19 cases in more than five months, the country's national health authority said on Monday, as new infections in Hebei province surrounding Beijing continued to rise.\nAs a result, China sealed off two cities south of Beijing, cutting transport links and banning millions of residents from leaving, as authorities move to stem the country's largest Covid-19 outbreak in six months.\nHebei province in northern China has seen 127 new Covid-19 cases, plus an additional 183 asymptomatic infections, in the past week.\nThe vast majority were found in Shijiazhuang, a city of several million in Hebei province whose surrounding areas take the total population to 11million. Nine confirmed cases were in the neighbouring city of Xingtai, whose area covers seven million people.\nThe surge comes as the World Health Organization's team of investigators probing the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic are set to arrive in China on Thursday. The NHC, which announced their arrival date on Monday, declined to provide the team's itinerary.\nChina has been accused of initially covering up the outbreak that first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, which critics say delayed China's initial response and allowed COVID-19 to spread globally.\nResidents of Shijiazhuang and Xingtai - situated some 80 miles apart - were banned from leaving unless absolutely necessary, Hebei authorities announced on Friday.\nThe Chinese National Health Commission has reported 53 confirmed cases for Thursday, including 37 native patients and 16 imported infections. Among the local cases, 33 were detected in Hebei.\nCity-wide mass testing drives started on Monday from Shijiazhuang's Gaocheng District, the epicentre of the Hebei outbreak.\nAs of Friday noon, all of the district's 673,787 residents had been tested and 511,219 swab samples had been analysed by labs, which found 259 positive cases, the city's vice mayor Meng Xianghong said at a press briefing.\nMass-testing campaigns in Shijiazhuang's other districts are still ongoing.\nOfficials vowed to 'strictly control the movement of people and vehicles', with all residential estates placed under 'closed management' - a euphemism for lockdown.\nHebei residents were also banned from entering Beijing or leaving the province unless absolutely necessary.\n'The outbreak was imported from abroad, but the exact origins are currently under in-depth investigation by state, provincial and municipal experts,' said Li Qi, head of the Hebei Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing Friday.\nWangkui county, under the jurisdiction of Suihua city in Heilongjiang province, reported eight new asymptomatic cases and moved on Monday to close all non-essential businesses, banned people from leaving the city and blocked all non-essential traffic, state television also reported.\nEach family in the county can have one person leave their home once every three days to buy necessities, the report said.\nChangchun, the capital city of Jilin province, reported four new asymptomatic cases on Monday -- the province's first local infections since July 26. The infected persons had all travelled from Wangkui county recently via train, Jilin health authorities said.\nThe residential compounds of the infected people were under lockdown, with people and vehicles not allowed to leave the premises, head of Changchun health authority told a press conference.\nThere are also mounting fears that travel plans for hundreds of millions of people for the Lunar New Year next month may be ruined as virus controls tighten.\nOfficials are starting to signal a low-key new-year holiday - which will run from February 11 to 17 - putting an end to the prospect of banquets, parties and public celebrations.\n'Mass celebrations, gatherings and fairs are forbidden,' said Kang Sen, of Beijing's agriculture and rural affairs authority, adding even funerals should be 'brief' and all public events would need prior approval.\nHis comments, carried over state media, appeared directed at villages in areas around the capital rather than the city itself.\nBut it the number of cases in China are a fraction of the daily infections in the United States, Britain and many European countries.\nChina's official toll stands at 4,634 deaths from Covid-19.\n"

But she needed to isolate after she came into contact with someone in Manchester who had it.\n'Luckily it all happened very quickly and Michelle did not return to the Brassic set before isolating. So it didn't affect filming too much.\n'She has spent last two weeks in total isolation. She will go back to filming at the end of this week.'\nMailOnline understands that Brassic worked around this and continued to films scenes Michelle doesn't feature in.\nLast week, Michelle hilariously revealed that she had stopped Dry January after just eight days.\nThe annual campaign sees people temporarily give up drinking for the whole of January to restore themselves after the overindulgence of the festive season.\nShe took to her Instagram Stories to share a hilarious Friends meme of Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, pouring herself a large glass of wine on the show.\nShowing off her fun side, Michelle captioned it with: 'Me... 8 days into \"Dry January\".'\nIt came after she took to Instagram Stories on New Year's Eve to spread positivity following the end of 'the hardest year for most' as she looked back on her memories.\nIn one photo from a holiday with husband Mark, 33, taken in July, Michelle said she was 'thankful' while posting another snap alongside her dad and brother from a different family break.\nMichelle begun by saying: 'Time to reflect on 2020… While it's probably been the hardest year for most, I wanted to end it on a positive note and highlight my favourite memories of 2020…'\nAlongside a snap of Michelle with brother Andrew and dad Michael, she said: 'Safe to say we had an amazing time… I'm thankful for these memories.'\nMichelle concluded: 'See you 2020, although you've been horrendous, you've also taught me a huge life lesson.\n'It's the little things that matter in this world.\n'Happy New Year everyone.

We just need to get out this vaccine.'\nShe said the first thing she will do after virus is over is to drive to the country to see her daughter Tara and grandchild, then fly to New York to see her grandchildren there.\nJoan added: 'Then I’ll fly to the South of France to see you Piers!'\nAfter the interview, Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid spoke briefly about missing their parents.\nSusanna said 'I can't wait to hug my parents', while Piers said : 'I haven’t hugged my mum since February, almost a year.'\n"

    "texto": "Indonesian divers have been scouring the Java Sea for wreckage and passenger belongings in hope of finding the black boxes from the jet which crashed on Saturday with 62 people on board.\nUnderwater footage of their rescue mission shows the divers examining the huge amount of debris from the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 which investigators say was still intact when it smashed into the sea.\nA child's Marvel backpack was among the distressing items found by the search team as they sifted through the wreckage from the plane which had plunged 10,000ft in a minute before the crash.\nAll 62 passengers and crew aboard the flight were Indonesian, including seven children and three babies.\nAround 2,600 personnel are working in the recovery effort, with dozens of boats and helicopters hauling body parts, twisted piece of wreckage and passengers' clothing from shallow waters about 75ft deep.\nBody bags filled with human remains are being taken to a police hospital where investigators hope to identify victims by matching DNA from their remains to living relatives.\nInvestigators have so far been unable to say why the 26-year-old plane crashed just four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, but say they do know the location of the black boxes in the sea.\nRetrieving the bright orange boxes - cockpit voice and flight data recorders - will likely help explain why the jet plunged so quickly.\nThey're built to survive at vast depths and in extreme heat, and are fitted with a beacon which can emit a signal for one month.\nThe devices record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations, and help explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.\nThe plane's captain, Afwan, a 54-year-old father of three, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, was a former air force pilot with decades of flying under his belt.\nHis nephew Ferza Mahardhika told BBC Indonesia that the pilot had left home quickly on the day of the flight, complaining that 'his shirt hadn't been ironed, when usually he is really neat'.\nAfwan also apologised to his children for having to leave home to board the doomed flight.\nHe was described as a devout Muslim who was always keen to help people in his community of Bogor.\nFerza Mahardhika said: 'He was a very good man. He often gave advice, wise advice. He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness.'\nAn investigator with Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said the jet possibly broke apart when it hit waters based on debris found so far.\n'We don't know for sure, but if we look at the debris, they're scattered in an area that is not too wide,' Nurcahyo Utomo said on Monday.\n'It possibly ruptured when it hit waters because if it had exploded midair, the debris would be distributed more widely,' he added.\nAviation analysts said flight-tracking data showed the plane sharply deviated from its intended course before it went into a steep dive, with bad weather, pilot error and mechanical malfunction among the potential factors.\n'Something quite dramatic has happened after takeoff,' said Stephen Wright, professor of aircraft systems at Finland's Tampere University.\n'The airspeed is far too low. The aircraft didn't accelerate up to the correct speeds for continuous flight.'\nIt comes as the heartbreaking final messages and posts have been revealed from passengers who shared photos on the plane before the crash.\nRatih Windania posted a selfie with her three children laughing as the family boarded the plane from the Indonesian capital.\nShe said: 'Bye bye family. We're heading home for now.'\n'Pray for us,' her brother Irfansyah Riyanto posted on Instagram with a picture of the family.\nHe said his family were originally planning to take a different flight but they changed at the last minute.\nLike dozens of other desperate relatives, Irfansyah rushed to Jakarta's Soekarno Hatta airport late on Saturday. On Sunday, he was still hoping for good news about his sister and four other family members on the flight, including his parents.\n'We feel powerless, we can only wait and hope to have any information soon,' Irfansyah told reporters.\nHis sister and her two children had been at the end of a three-week holiday and were taking the 460 mile trip home to Pontianak on the island of West Kalimantan.\n'I was the one who drove them to the airport, helped with the check-ins and the luggage ... I feel like I still can't believe this and it happened too fast,' Irfansyah said.\nRapin Akbar, who gave a blood sample to the hospital to help police identify any bodies retrieved, had five relatives on board including an older sister, a nephew and his wife and their seven-month-old baby.\nThey were also flying back to Pontianak, the city on Indonesia's section of Borneo island which had been flight SJ182's destination, about 90 minutes away.\n'(My nephew) had planned to go back to Pontianak on Sunday but changed his mind and decided to fly on Saturday instead,' the shocked Akbar told AFP.\n'He called me to say the flight was delayed and sent me a picture of their baby. It was (their) first.'\nAt the police hospital, the brother of co-pilot Diego Mamahit said he had been asked for a blood sample.\n'I believe my younger brother survived, these are just for the police procedure,' Chris Mamahit said. 'Diego is a good man, we still believe Diego survived.'\nOn his LinkedIn profile, Mahamit had written 'I really love to fly.'\n'We the family still hope for good news,' a family member of Afwan, a devout Muslim, told Detik.com.\nAlso on board was Dinda Amelia, who had gone to Jakarta on holiday for her 15th birthday, seaman Angga Fernanda Afrion who became a father for the first time last week, and newly-married couple Ihsan Adhlan Hakim and Putri Wahyuni.\n'We are making our best efforts to find and rescue the victims and we all pray that they can be found,' he said.\nPanca Widiya Nursanti, a middle-school teacher in Pontianak, had been returning after a vacation in her home town of Tegal in Central Java. In Pontianak, her husband Rafiq Yusuf Al Idrus recounted the last contact he had with her.\n'I was joking by saying that when she arrived in Pontianak we would eat satay together,' he said.\n'She contacted me via Whatsapp at 2.05 p.m with laughter. She was already boarding the plane and she said the weather conditions were not good. I said pray a lot, please.'\nA fisherman, named Solihin, told the BBC that he had been at sea when he witnessed the plane crash into the water near to his ship.\n'The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water. It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship.\n'We thought it was a bomb or a tsunami since after that we saw the big splash from the water.\n'It was raining heavily and the weather was so bad... We were very shocked and directly saw the plane debris and the fuel around our boat.'\nLocals on a nearby island said they heard two explosions before discovering metal pieces, cables and fragments of a pair of jeans floating in the sea.\nThe missing plane is an older model than the Boeing 737 MAX jet involved in two earlier fatal crashes - including the Indonesian Lion Air crash in 2018 which killed 189.\nTransportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said the doomed flight was delayed for an hour before it took off at 2.36pm.\nBut the aircraft disappeared from radar four minutes later, after the pilot contacted air traffic control to ascend to an altitude 8,839 meters.\nSriwijaya Air, which flies to destinations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, has said little about the plane, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines.\nThe Indonesian carrier has not recorded a fatal crash since it started operations in 2003.\nBut the Southeast Asian nation's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from entering US and European airspace.\nIn October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.\nThat accident - and another in Ethiopia - saw Boeing hit with $2.5 billion in fines over claims it defrauded regulators overseeing the 737 MAX model, which was grounded worldwide following the accidents.\nThe 737 model that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.\nIn 2014, an AirAsia plane headed from Surabaya to Singapore crashed with the loss of 162 lives.\nA year later more than 140 people, including scores on the ground, were killed when a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Medan on Sumatra island.\n"
